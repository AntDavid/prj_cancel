{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A company faces a significant challenge related to frequent plan cancellations. To address this issue, I conducted a comprehensive analysis project, employing both theoretical and experimental approaches. It's important to note that this project is not based on a real-world case but rather serves as an experimental activity aimed at practicing and refining analytical skills.\n","\n","Throughout this initiative, I identified cancellation trends, analyzed underlying factors, and proposed strategic solutions to effectively mitigate and resolve the problem.\n","\n","During the analysis process, we outlined recurring cancellation patterns, allowing for a deeper understanding of the reasons behind this trend. Through a proactive approach, we applied detailed research methods and data analysis to extract valuable insights into customer behavior and the inflection points that lead to plan cancellations.\n","\n","Based on the results, we developed and implemented customized strategies, targeting specific areas identified as prone to high cancellation rates. These solutions were designed not only to contain cancellation rates but also to enhance customer satisfaction, thereby strengthening brand loyalty.\n","\n","In summary, the analysis project played a crucial role in identifying, understanding, and theoretically and experimentally resolving the plan cancellation problem, contributing to the stability and sustainable growth of the company.\n","\n","By Antonio David Santana\n","\n","E-mail: davidantoniodavi2@gmail.com\n","\n","LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/antonlo-davld\n","\n","GitHub:

retention. As a former physics student, there's an interesting joke we often used that fits well in this situation: \"When a mechanics experiment fails, it's because the physicist habitually neglected friction\" Therefore, in this situation, I understand that there may be challenges hindering the implementation of all solutions, depending on the financial situation of the company, and it requires time and coordination across departments. However, I believe the solutions are applicable, and in a real-world scenario, they can be implemented based on the company's needs and financial conditions."],"metadata":{"id":"Wxu0n3RNZQ5a"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
